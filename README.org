#+title: Sample Sui Scripts

* How to run these scripts?

#+begin_src sh
  $ npm install # install necessary tools
  $ cd scripts
  $ npx ts-node SCRIPT_FILENAME
#+end_src

For example, to run the script ~testMoveCall.ts~, just run

#+begin_src sh
  $ npx ts-node testMoveCall.ts
#+end_src

NOTE: you are required to set the environment variables PK_B64 and NETWORK. This repository uses ~dotenv~. Hence a ~.env~ file is required in the current working directory.
